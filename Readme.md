VADER - Versatile Accelerated Digital Encryption Recovery
===

The VADER system is an FPGA-based accelerator which recovers passwords using a brute-force attack. It was implemented on the Digilent Nexys 3, and achieved an 11 times speed-up over a computer-based version programmed in Python. 

The Xilinx ISE project for programming the FPGA and the "Golden Measure" - the PC based version for performance comparison - are listed in this repository.
